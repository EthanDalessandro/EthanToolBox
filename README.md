A lightweight utility toolbox for Unity, featuring a simple Dependency Injection system.

## Installation

You can install this package directly from GitHub via the Unity Package Manager.

1. Open your Unity Project.
2. Go to **Window > Package Manager**.
3. Click the **+** icon in the top-left corner.
4. Select **Add package from git URL...**.
5. Enter the following URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/EthanDalessandro/EthanToolBox.git?path=/Assets/EthanToolBox
   ```

## Features

### Dependency Injection

A lightweight DI system to manage your game's dependencies.

**Quick Start:**

1. **Create a Service:**
   ```csharp
   public class MyService
   {
       public void DoSomething() => Debug.Log("Hello!");
   }
   ```

2. **Create an Installer (Composition Root):**
   Create a script inheriting from `CompositionRoot` and attach it to a GameObject in your scene.
   ```csharp
   using EthanToolBox.Core.DependencyInjection;

   public class GameInstaller : DICompositionRoot
   {
       protected override void Configure(DIContainer container)
       {
           container.RegisterSingleton<MyService>(new MyService());
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Inject into a MonoBehaviour:**
   Add the `[Inject]` attribute to any field you want to populate.
   ```csharp
   public class Player : MonoBehaviour
   {
       [Inject] private MyService _myService;

       private void Start()
       {
           _myService.DoSomething();
       }
   }
   ```


### System Characteristics

**When to use this DI System?**
This system is designed for **Small to Medium-sized projects**, **Prototypes**, or **Tool Development**. It provides the core benefits of Dependency Injection without the complexity and performance overhead of large frameworks like Zenject or VContainer.

**Strengths:**
- **Lightweight:** Minimal performance impact and small codebase.
- **Simple:** Very low learning curve. Easy to setup and debug.
- **No External Dependencies:** Keeps your project clean.
- **Explicit:** You control exactly what gets registered and injected.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Manual Registration:** You must manually register services in the Composition Root.
- **Basic Features:** Does not support complex features like circular dependency resolution, sub-containers, or conditional bindings.
- **Scene Scanning:** The auto-injection relies on `FindObjectsByType`, which can be slow on very large scenes with thousands of MonoBehaviours (though this can be optimized by manually injecting specific objects).

## Requirements

- Unity 2021.3 or higher.
